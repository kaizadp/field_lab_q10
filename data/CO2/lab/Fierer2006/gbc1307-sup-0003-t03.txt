aMAT, mean annual temperature; MMT, mean monthly temperature (historical averages); SMD, average annual soil moisture deficit. Variables are listed in order of the strength of their correlation; except for the first two cases, no correlations were significant at the P = 0.10 level.		
 bValues log-transformed in order to normalize data before performing correlation analyses.		
cCorrelation with Bonferroni-corrected significance at P <0.001 level.		
d Correlation with Bonferroni-corrected significance at P < 0.01 level.
