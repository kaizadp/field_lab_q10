Table 4. Other Published Experimental Studies In Which an Inverse Relationship Between Measured Q10 Values and Substrate Quality Has Been Observeda 				
Reference	Study Characteristics	Temperature Range of Q10 Measurements	Range in Measured Q10 Values	Description of Results
Time Course Studies				
Fierer, et al. [2005]	53-day incubation of 24 litter samples	10degrees-30degreesC	2.1-3.4	significant relationships between Q10 and B with incubation time
Fang, et al. [2005]	100-day incubation of 4 soils	4degrees-44degreesC	2.0-2.6	over the course of the incubation, respiration rates decreased by ~~60% and Q10s increased by ~~10%
Variable Substrate Studies				
Leifeld and Fuhrer [2005]	4 fractionated soils	5degrees-25degreesC	3-15	across the different soil fractions, Q10s were inversely related to CO2 production rate
Fierer, et al. [2005]	24 grass litters	10degrees-30degreesC	2.1-3.4	generally strong relationship between B and Q10 across a range of litter types
Mikan, et al. [2002]	5 arctic tundra soils	0.5degrees-14degreesC	4.6-9.4	strong relationship between B and Q10  (r2=0.94)
Fierer, et al. [2003a]	6 soils from depth profile	10degrees-35degreesC	2.8-4.1	large decrease in B with soil depth corresponded to significant increase in Q10
this study	77 soils	10degrees-30degreesC	2.2-4.6	significant inverse relationship between Q10 and B
aSubstrate quality is defined as microbial CO2 production per unit total organic C. "Time course studies" are those studies in which an individual soil or litter type was incubated over time and Q10 was measured at specific intervals during the incubation as substrate quality declined with time. "Variable substrate studies" refers to those studies where Q10 were values were determined simultaneously on >3 distinct litter or soil types. Because of methodological differences between studies, we have not attempted to compare these studies in a quantitative manner.
